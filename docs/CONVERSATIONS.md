# Capturing Conversational Data

While capturing factual accuracy of a subject (professional experience, most recent bike ride, favorite food, etc.) was the first set of data extracted and loaded for this project, capturing conversational style is another important aspect of Mirroring a subject.

To add this functionality we need
1. A dataset of conversations between the Subject and another person(s)
2. A way to fine-tune the conversational style of the LLM
3. Use of the fine-tuned LLM rather than the generic base model
