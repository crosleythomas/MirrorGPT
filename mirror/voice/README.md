# Voice Integration

This package contains utilities for connecting text-to-speech models for giving your Mirror Agent a voice.

There are 3 main pieces to solve:
1. Getting sample data of your voice (either by manually recording sample audio or pulling it from existing sources like your Zoom calls)
2. Create a voice clone
3. Integrating that voice with the Mirror Agent's text output
